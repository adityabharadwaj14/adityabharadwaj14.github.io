## Welcome to my webpage

I am Aditya Bharadwaj, a student at the [Technische Universiteit Delft](https://tudelft.nl), following the Embedded Systems Master programme. I am currently working on my thesis with the Bioelectronics research group at the faculty of [Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/) and I expect to graduate soon, in the summer of 2020.

I am eager to work full-time on challenging projects thereafter, and I am looking forward to discussing such opportunities. Do get in touch with me [via email](mailto:adityabharadwaj121[at]gmail[dot]com)!
